# MirrorDown

## Description
MirrorDown is a 3D game developed in early 2019 as part of an introduction to Unity and C#. Unfortunately, due to a critical data loss, all development files were lost, leading to the project's abandonment.

In this game, several levels were designed with different gameplay mechanics:

## Levels

### Level 1 - Platforming Basics
The first level served as an introduction to object placement in a 3D environment, basic texture and color modifications, and collision box understanding. It is a first-person platformer where players must find their way to a purple portal using multiple possible paths.

### Level 2 - Aerial Mode & Level Transitions
From this level onwards, gameplay became more experimental. The main goal was to test aerial movement and understand how scripts handle transitions between levels. This level marked the first executable (`.exe`) version of the game. The objective is to avoid obstacles and land safely on the platform at the other end of the level. Since it is a linear world, players must always move forward. In case of death, an instant respawn occurs at the starting point.

### Level 3 - Puzzle & Maze
This level was created beyond the initial learning phase as a personal experiment in game logic. It is a puzzle/maze where the goal is to reach a hidden tree inside a house. Various hidden or visible switches unlock doors, granting access to different rooms within the house.

### Level 4 - Unfinished Concept
Level 4 was intended to extend the game and introduce additional content but was never completed.

## Notes
- Throughout the game, the name "NoxProduction" may appear. This was the developer's original pseudonym and is no longer relevant.

## Status
This project remains abandoned due to the loss of development files.

## License
No official license applies as the project is incomplete and no longer maintained.
